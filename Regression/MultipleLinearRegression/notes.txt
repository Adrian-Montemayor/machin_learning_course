5 Methods of bulding models:

1. All in
2. Backward Elimination 
3. Forward Selection
4. Bidirectional Elimination
5. Score Comparison 


All in - cases:
    Prior knowledge; 
    You have to
    Preparing for backward Elimination

Backward Elimination:
Step1: Select a significance level to stay in the models
step2: Fit the full model with all possible predictors
step3: Consider the predictor with the highest P-value if 
P > SL, go to step 4 otherwise go to FIN
step4: remove the predictor
step5: fit model without this variable

Forward Selection:
Step1: Select a significance level to enter the model (SL = 0.05)
step2: fit all regression models y -Xn select the one with the lowest P-value
step3: keep this variable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor
added to the one(s) you already have
step4: consider the predictor with the lowest P-value
if P < SL go to step 3, otherwise go to FIN.

Bidirectional Elimination
step1: Select a significance level to enter and to stay in the model
E.G: SLENTER =0.05, SLSTAY= 0.05
step2: Perform the next step of forward selection (new variables must have P < SLENTER to enter)
step 3: Perform all steps of backward elimination (Old variables must have P <SLSTAY to stay)
step4: No new variables can enter and no old variables can exit:
FIN.

All possible models
step1: select a criterion go goodness of fit
step2: construct all possible regression models 2^n -1 total combinations
step3: select the one with the best criterion
fin.
